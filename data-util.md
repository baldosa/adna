- Las IA tienen que recordar todo el pozo (variable nueva o leer pozo?), tal vez llevar cuantas cartas quedan disponibles, qué cartas pueden tener los otros, etc. Calcular probabilidades.

  - Sort by number, not by color. When given the choice, play number duplicates first.
  - If you're doing tournament play, play out your high point cards first. It's golf scoring, so you want as few points as possible over the long term.
  - Start playing the cards/colors you have most from. If you have three 6s, try to play them first
  - i would say that if you had a stack, like 3 6s of different or same colours, save them till the end. You'll less likely get drawn cards on by other players than having one card, even though they both only take one round to eliminate. Remember the other players don't know you have a stack.
